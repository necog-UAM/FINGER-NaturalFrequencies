%% This script should be run after FINGER7_WS_fingerprintng or FINGER7_BS_fingerprintng to calculate Identifiability and Differentiability
% The input needed is the matrix of correlations obtained in FINGER7 (Corr_matrix) and Matches_01. 
% You can use this script with Corr_matrix and Matches_01 of within-session group or with Corr_matrix and Matches_01 of between-session group. Load the corresponding Corr_matrix and Matches_01 accordingly.
% The outputs are graphic bars of Differentiability and Identifiability and the statistics.

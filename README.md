# FINGER-NaturalFrequencies-
FINGER-NaturalFrequencies Matlab code used to perform the analysis and generate the figures for the following paper:
Arana, L., Herrera-Morueco, J. J., Santonja, J., Capilla, A. (2025). Guess Who? Identifying individuals from their brain natural frequency fingerprints. BioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.21.634078
The script names include the prefix FINGER, followed by a number indicating the order in which the scripts should be run, and the letters WS or BS, which denote whether the script corresponds to the within-session (WS) or between-session (BS) analysis.
The main folder and its subfolders (functions and mat_files) should be added to the Matlab path.
